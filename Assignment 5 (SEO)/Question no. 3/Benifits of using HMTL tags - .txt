Benifits of using HMTL tags :- 

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) tags are fundamental components of web development that provide structure and meaning to content on a webpage. Here are some benefits of using HTML tags:

1. Semantic Structure: HTML tags give meaning to content. By using tags like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, and <section>, you provide semantic meaning to different parts of your webpage. This helps search engines understand the content and improves accessibility for users of assistive technologies.

2. Accessibility: Properly structured HTML is crucial for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. Screen readers, for example, rely on well-organized HTML to convey information to visually impaired users.

3. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines use the structure of your HTML to understand the content and context of your web pages. Using semantic HTML elements correctly can improve your site's SEO, making it more discoverable in search results.

4. Consistency and Maintainability: Using HTML tags helps maintain consistency across a website. It also makes it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on a project since they can quickly understand the structure of the page.

5. CSS Styling: HTML tags provide hooks for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to apply styles to different elements. Without proper HTML structure, styling becomes more challenging and less consistent.

6. Document Outline: HTML tags help in creating a clear document outline. This is essential for users who navigate a page using assistive technologies or for those who prefer to quickly skim content.
