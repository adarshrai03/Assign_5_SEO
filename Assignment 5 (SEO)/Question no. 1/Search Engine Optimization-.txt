Search Engine Optimization:-

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a set of practices and strategies used to improve a website's visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by optimizing various aspects of the site to align with search engine algorithms.

Importance of SEO:

1. Increased Visibility and Traffic: Effective SEO strategies can help your website rank higher in search results, making it more likely for users 				     to find and visit your site.

2. Credibility and Trust: Websites that appear at the top of search results are often perceived as more trustworthy and credible by users.

3. Better User Experience: SEO practices often overlap with strategies that improve user experience, which can lead to higher user satisfaction 			   and engagement.

4. Higher Conversion Rates: When your website is optimized for relevant keywords and provides valuable content, it's more likely to attract users 			    who are genuinely interested in your offerings, increasing the likelihood of conversions.

5. Cost-Effectiveness: Organic search traffic is free, unlike paid advertising. While SEO may require an initial investment, its long-term 			       benefits often outweigh the costs associated with paid advertising.
